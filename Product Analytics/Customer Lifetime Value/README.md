### ðŸ’¡ LTV (Customer Lifetime Value)

How much total revenue you expect to earn from one customer over the entire time they stay with your product or service.

> Think of it as the *long-term value* of a customer â€” not just their first purchase.

---

#### ðŸ§® How Itâ€™s Calculated

**Basic formula:**  

`LTV = Average Order Value Ã— Purchase Frequency Ã— Customer Lifespan`

Or:  

`LTV = Monthly Revenue per User Ã— Avg. # of Months They Stay`

---

#### ðŸ§  Why It Matters

- Tells you how much you *can afford* to spend to acquire a customer.
- Guides decisions around pricing, retention, and marketing investment.
- Higher LTV = more sustainable and scalable growth.

#### âœ… Quick Rule of Thumb

**LTV should be at least 3Ã— your CAC**  

If your average CAC is $50, aim for an LTV of $150 or more.
