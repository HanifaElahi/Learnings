# CSV vs JSON vs Parquet


When dealing with data, choosing the right file format can impact storage, performance, and ease of use. CSV, JSON, and Parquet are three widely used formats, each with strengths and weaknesses.

---

##  Definitions

- #### CSV (Comma-Separated Values):

A plain text format where data is stored in rows, with each value separated by a comma. It is widely used for its simplicity and compatibility.

- #### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):

A lightweight, human-readable format that uses key-value pairs to store data. It is commonly used for web APIs and configuration files.

- #### Parquet:

A columnar storage format optimized for performance and efficiency. It is designed for big data processing and analytics.

---

## Structure

#### CSV:

- Rows represent records, and columns represent fields.

- Example:

```bash
Name, Age, City
John, 25, New York
Jane, 30, Los Angeles
```

#### JSON:

- Data is stored as key-value pairs, often nested.

- Example:

```bash
[
  {"Name": "John", "Age": 25, "City": "New York"},
  {"Name": "Jane", "Age": 30, "City": "Los Angeles"}
]
```

#### Parquet:

- Data is stored in a columnar format, with metadata for efficient querying.

- Example:

(Not human-readable; requires tools like Apache Parquet Viewer to inspect.)

## Use Cases

- CSV → Small-scale data storage, spreadsheets, lightweight data exchange

- JSON → Web APIs, configuration files, semi-structured data storage

- Parquet → Big data processing, data lakes, analytics with tools like Spark & Hive

---

## Similarities

- All three formats are used to store and exchange data.
- They are widely supported by various tools and programming languages.
- Can handle structured and semi-structured data.

## Key Differences

| Feature        | CSV            | JSON           | Parquet        |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Structure** | Rows & columns (flat) | Key-value pairs (nested possible) | Columnar (optimized for analytics) |
| **Readability** | Human-readable | Human-readable | Not easily readable |
| **Compression** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Storage Efficiency** | Large file sizes | Moderate | Small file sizes |
| **Query Performance** | Slow for large data | Moderate | Fast (especially for analytics) |
| **Schema Support** | No | Yes (flexible) | Yes (strict) |
| **Best For** | Simple, small datasets | Semi-structured data, APIs | Large-scale analytics |

## Pros & Cons

### ✅ CSV

✔ Simple, universally supported  
✔ Easy to read & edit manually  
❌ Large file sizes, inefficient for big data  
❌ No schema enforcement (can lead to inconsistent data)  

### ✅ JSON

✔ Flexible & supports nested structures  
✔ Used widely in web applications & APIs  
❌ Can be inefficient for large datasets  
❌ Harder to query in traditional databases  

### ✅ Parquet

✔ Great for large-scale data analytics  
✔ Highly compressed & efficient  
✔ Fast querying due to columnar storage  
❌ Not human-readable  
❌ More complex to handle than CSV or JSON

## Use Cases

- **CSV** → Small-scale data storage, spreadsheets, lightweight data exchange
- **JSON** → Web APIs, configuration files, semi-structured data storage
- **Parquet** → Big data processing, data lakes, analytics with tools like Spark & Hive

---

## Which One to Choose?

- **Need a simple file?** → CSV
- **Working with APIs or semi-structured data?** → JSON
- **Handling large-scale analytics?** → Parquet

---

There’s no one-size-fits-all format. Choose based on data size, structure, and use case. CSV is great for simplicity, JSON works well for flexibility, and Parquet shines in big data analytics.
